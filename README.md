# SpeechEmotionRecognition
Recognize the emotion in the speech using various machine learning and deep learning models.

To do the analysis, Iâ€™ve explored datasets containing audio and video files by professional actors in different emotional sequences (happy, angry, sad, surprised, frightened, neutral and calm). Since we are primarily focusing on processing the speech, the audio has been extracted from the video files. Then, the speech features such as, Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) has been generated from the speech. Various machine learning and deep learning models have been built ranging from the XGBoost to Conventional Neural Network (CNN). With careful hyperparameter optimization, the F1 score shot from 57% to 92%.
